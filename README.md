# get_next_line_for_school_42

my second project for school 42
in this project you need to write function that reads a string from a file descriptor, reads the size of BUFFER_SIZE and writes it to the string that it allocates,
also next read must start from the same place
bonus part: it should only use one static varible and should work with different file descriptors at the same time.

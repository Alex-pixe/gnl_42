# get_next_line_for_school_42

My second project for school 42.  
In this project you need to write function that reads a string from a file descriptor.  
Reads the size of BUFFER_SIZE and writes it to the string that it allocates,  
also next read must start from the same place.  
  
Bonus part: it should only use one static varible and should work with different  
file descriptors at the same time.
